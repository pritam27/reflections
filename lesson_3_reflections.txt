When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with others on a particular project.
When you frequently keep changing your work place, 
so you can access your latest commits via remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When you are working in collaboration with others, you do not want 
all the changes on a branch being committed by others to affect the 
branch in your local repository.
You may want to keep your view of the branch and pull the changes only if
it makes sense to you to do so.
Also, you don't want others to tamper with your work that you
as a team-player deserve privacy with your local sub-project.
