What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Difference between git repository and normal directory
--> The git repository contains '.git' hidden directory which stores 
all the metadata about the git directory since it was created.
By 'git init', it creates '.git' hidden repository, which is 
indicative of the fact that the normal directory has now 
turned into a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory contains all the files stored on hard drive under the directory
When you run 'git init', it creates an empty git repository which
will contain a snapshot of your files in the working directory
depending on which files you want to commit.
Staging area is the intermediate between the two, it allows
you to make a decisoin as to which files from the working directory
do you want to commit to the git repository.
By running 'git add file', these files are now tracked for changes,
i.e. they are added to the staging area.
