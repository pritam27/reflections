What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Difference between git repository and normal directory
--> The git repository contains '.git' hidden directory which stores 
all the metadata about the git directory since it was created.
By 'git init', it creates '.git' hidden repository, which is 
indicative of the fact that the normal directory has now 
turned into a git repository.
